Data Preparation
Collected daily data (2014-2023) for:
  Bitcoin (BTC-USD)
  Major indices (DJI, IXIC, SPX)
  Calculated log returns
  Aligned dates across all series (2,333 observations)

2. Exploratory Analysis
Visualizations:
  Price trends and return distributions (facetted plots)
  Histograms and boxplots of returns
Descriptive statistics:
  Bitcoin shows highest volatility (SD = 0.045 vs 0.011-0.013 for indices)
  Negative skewness (-0.35) and excess kurtosis (11.9) in Bitcoin

3. VAR Modeling
Stationarity confirmed via ADF tests (p < 0.01 for all returns)
Optimal lag selection: 4 lags (AIC/BIC criteria)
VAR(4) estimation reveals:
  Significant Bitcoin autocorrelation (L1-L4: 0.07 to -0.05)
  DJI/IXIC/SPX show stronger persistence

4. Diagnostic Checks
No serial correlation (Portmanteau test p = 0.35)
Non-normal residuals (Jarque-Bera p < 0.001)
ARCH effects present (multivariate test p < 0.001)
Stable model (CUSUM test within bounds)

5. Structural Analysis (SVAR)
Recursive identification via Cholesky decomposition:
Impulse Response Functions show:
  Bitcoin shocks have persistent self-effects (40+ days)
  Limited impact on indices (max 0.2% response in DJI)
  Index shocks quickly dissipate in Bitcoin

Key Technical Components:
Used vars package for VAR/SVAR implementation
Formatted results with stargazer and rempsyc for readability
Conducted comprehensive causality/structural analysis
Employs modern tidyverse workflow for data manipulation
This analysis demonstrates Bitcoin's relative isolation from traditional market dynamics while highlighting its unique volatility characteristics.
