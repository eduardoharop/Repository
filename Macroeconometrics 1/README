Files for the Macroeconometrics 1 course assignments:

1. Data Preparation & Exploration
Loaded macroeconomic dataset containing:
HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices)
Energy price index (HICPenergy)
Economic output
Initial visualizations:
  Time series plots of raw series
  ACF/PACF analysis showing persistent autocorrelation

2. Stationarity Analysis
Conducted Dickey-Fuller tests:
  Original HICP series: non-stationary (p=0.99)
  1st difference: Stationary (p=0.0002, I(1))
  Energy prices became stationary after 1st differencing
  Output required 2nd differencing (I(2))

3. Transformations & Modeling
Created logarithmic transformations:
  df["lHICP"] = np.log(df['HICP'])
  df["lHICPenergy"] = np.log(df['HICPenergy'])
  df["loutput"] = np.log(df['output'])
Estimated ARDL models:
  Differenced specification (I(1)): ARDL(1,1,2)
  Log-level specification: ARDL(2,2,2)
Cointegration test between log energy prices and HICP changes:
  p-value=0.38 âž” No cointegration relationship

4. Model Validation
Final training set: First 239 observations
Preserved test set for out-of-sample evaluation
Compared specifications using information criteria
