Files for the Time Series Analysis course project:

Part 1: Univariate Analysis
Data Preparation:
  Fetched daily stock prices (2018-2023) and calculated log returns
  Visualized price trends and return distributions with histograms/boxplots
  Performed descriptive statistics and outlier detection
Stationarity & Models:
  Conducted ADF tests (log prices non-stationary, returns stationary)
  Fit ARIMA models:
  MSFT: ARIMA(1,0,4)
  WMT: ARIMA(0,0,4)
  Residual diagnostics revealed volatility clustering
GARCH Modeling:
  Implemented GARCH(1,1) with normal and t-distributed errors
  Model selection using information criteria
  Diagnostic checks (ACF/PACF of squared residuals, QQ-plots)
  Forecasted volatility 2 days ahead
Stylized Facts:
Tested for zero mean returns (significant for WMT)
Evaluated leverage effects (GJR-GARCH) and risk premia (GARCH-M)

Part 2: Risk Analysis
Value-at-Risk (VaR):
  Historical VaR (1-5 day horizons)
  Parametric VaR using:
  Simple GARCH(1,1) with normal errors
  ARMA-GARCH models
  Student-t distributed innovations
  Portfolio VaR using correlation-based approach
Key Results:
  VaR estimates scaled to $10M portfolio
  Student-t models showed better fit for fat tails
  Multivariate approach incorporated correlation (œÅ = 0.19)
  Implementation Highlights:
  Used rugarch for GARCH modeling and forecasting
  Automated model selection with custom auto.garch function
  Generated publication-ready tables with stargazer
  Comprehensive visual diagnostics (ACF/PACF, QQ-plots, volatility forecasts)
