Project done in my Spatial Econometrics class:

1. Data Preparation & Exploration
  Loaded Portuguese real estate spatial data (278 observations)
Created derived variables:
  Area-adjusted metrics (e.g., newhouseparea = new houses per km²)
  Economic indicators (e.g., unemploymentrate)
Visualized key variables:
  Choropleth map of median values per m² (medvalsqm2)
  Correlation matrix of all variables

2. Spatial Dependency Analysis
Created Queen contiguity weights matrix
Calculated global Moran's I = 0.44 (p<0.001), confirming spatial autocorrelation
Conducted Lagrange Multiplier tests:
  Both lag (RLMlag = 27.7) and error (RLMerror = 4.9) dependencies significant
  Robust LM tests favored spatial lag model

3. Model Comparison
Tested 5 spatial econometric models:
  OLS: Showed spatial autocorrelation in residuals (Moran's I p<0.001)
  SEM (Spatial Error): Hausman test rejected (χ²=21.3, p=0.002)
  SLX (Spatial Lag of X): LR test vs SDM p<0.001
  SAR (Spatial Autoregressive): ρ=0.32 (p<0.001)
  SDM (Spatial Durbin): Best fit via LR tests
SDM coefficients showed:
  Positive spatial spillovers (ρ=0.31)
  Significant local effects: Population density (-0.14), tourism (+0.18)

4. Diagnostics
Heteroskedasticity present (BP test p<0.001)
Significant spatial impacts:
  Direct effects: popdens (-0.12), touracc (+0.15)
  Indirect effects: newhouse (-0.09), active (+0.07)

5. Output
Exported modified shapefile for Stata compatibility

Key findings: Housing values show strong spatial interdependence, with tourism activity and population dynamics driving both local and neighboring area prices
This analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for spatial effects in real estate valuation models, with SDM providing the best fit for this dataset.
